Advent of Code 2019
===================

This are my solutions for the 2019 edition of the [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com).  
These solutions are all implemented in [**Rust**](https://rust-lang.org).  

I started a bit late (Dec 8, 2019) but I haven't spoiled my self any solutions yet, so I'll be catching up.  

How to run
----------

Here is how you can run each solutions:

```bash
# This will run the solution for day 1.
cargo run --bin day1

# This will run the solution for day 2.
cargo run --bin day2

# And so on, up to day25...
```
